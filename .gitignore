# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install different versions of packages depending on
#   the platform. Pipfile.lock may vary on different platforms.
#   In such cases, it may be better to ignore Pipfile.lock and include the requirements text file
#   instead.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   The poetry.lock file ensures that everyone working on the project has the same versions of
-e .
#   dependencies.
# poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
